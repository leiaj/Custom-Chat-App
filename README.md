# Custom-Chat-App

About:

Create a private or public chatroom that represents any physical space you want. You can now hang out with your friends (or strangers) in a room that looks however the users want it to. Name your chatroom, pick a background image, invite your friends and collaborate in decorating the space. Upload your own items to the image bank and drag them around the room.

Users with accounts are the only ones able to create chatrooms but an account is not necessary to join a chat.
